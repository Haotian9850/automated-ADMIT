vlsr: local standard rest speed. Fixed. 8 km / s

numsigma: minimum intensity for a channel not to be considered as noise. Default 5.0. Lower values better for lower sound / noise ratio

minchan: minimum number of consecutive channels above numsigma to consider them parts of a molecular line. Default 4. Depends on width of line in the spectra

smooth: whether the input spectra is smoothed. Uses multiple algorithms. Default: not smooth. Very noisy spectra may require smoothing for more accurate identifications

maxgap: opposite of minchan

parameters of concern: numsigma, minchan, maxgap
